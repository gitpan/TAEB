-- GETTING TAEB

The preferred method for obtaining the TAEB source is from the darcs repo:
    darcs get --partial http://sartak.org/code/TAEB/

Alternatively, you can download "http://sartak.org/dist/TAEB.tar.gz" and
extract to the directory of your choice.

You can also download TAEB from the CPAN: cpan -i TAEB

Downloading the tarball or installing from CPAN means less work up front (no
need to install darcs), but it'll be more work every time you want to update.


-- INSTALLING FROM TARBALL

If you're on Ubuntu, you'll first need to install the "build-essential" (for
make) and "libncurses5-dev" (for the Curses library) packages. If you are on OS
X, you will need Xcode and probably a few packages from MacPorts.


$ perl Makefile.PL

Answer the defaults to any dependencies it asks about. You may have to
set up CPAN. The defaults are usually fine. Be sure to set a mirror though.

$ make && sudo make install

This will install the modules from CPAN. TAEB's dependencies themselves
usually have a few dependencies. All in all you're probably looking at
about 60 modules.


-- AI

Though TAEB ships with a demo AI, you should still install a robust AI. The
most actively developed AI is Behavioral. The preferred method to get it is
still through darcs:
    darcs get --partial http://sartak.org/code/TAEB-AI-Behavioral

Or you can get a tarball from
"http://sartak.org/dist/TAEB-AI-Behavioral.tar.gz" or the CPAN.


-- CONFIGURATION

TAEB itself has a lot of configuration. It sets up some sensible defaults for
you (such as playing nethack locally with the Demo AI and communicating with
you via Curses). You aren't required to set up config, but if you want to
change how TAEB operates, such as by making him play on a NetHack server, you
can. Specify configuration in ~/.taeb/config.yml, which is written in YAML
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaml). Read the sample configuration in
TAEB::Config for more details.

TAEB requires certain NetHack options to be set in order to recognize
dungeon features, and to not get confused by extra output. These options
can be displayed by running "taeb --rc". For the Local interface, these will
automatically be copied into $TAEBDIR/nethackrc for use by TAEB. To
play on a DGameLaunch server such as nethack.alt.org, use the Telnet
interface, and copy the nethackrc into the configuration editor.


-- RUNNING TAEB

You should now be ready to run TAEB! Type "taeb" and cross your fingers.
